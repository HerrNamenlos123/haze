# 🌱 A New Language for High-Level, Safe, Performant Application Code

## Why This Language Exists

Modern programming often forces a painful trade-off between *performance*, *safety*, and *ergonomics*. On one side, you have languages like **Rust** that offer strong guarantees but with steep learning curves, verbose syntax, and cognitive overhead. On the other, languages like **Go** and **Python** provide simplicity and speed of development—but at the cost of low-level control or runtime performance.

This language takes a **radically pragmatic** approach to application programming by offering:

* ✨ **Ergonomics** inspired by Python, TypeScript, and Go
* 🛡️ **Memory safety** without garbage collection or RAII
* ⚡ **Performance** close to C, using arenas as a simple and effective memory model
* 🔁 **Hot-reloading** support for rapid development and modular systems
* 🧱 **Incremental compilation** and a compiler-as-a-service model for blazing-fast developer feedback
* 🚀 **Go-like CLI and packaging** to eliminate build system complexity
* 🧩 **Precompiled libraries** that bundle static and dynamic versions for seamless linking
* 🎯 **Purpose-built for high-level application logic**, not low-level systems code

## Core Idea: Arenas, Not GC or RAII

At the heart of the language is a **first-class arena model**:

* Every allocation lives inside an arena.
* Arenas can create sub-arenas, automatically cleaned up via `defer` or scoped APIs.
* No object can outlive its arena — enforced at compile time.
* For resizing data structures (e.g. strings, arrays), *buffers* attach to arenas, using their own memory but inheriting the arena’s lifetime.
* Temporary allocations use a hidden per-thread scratch arena with push/pop semantics.

This model avoids the unpredictability of GC and the complexity of Rust's borrow checker, while enabling **safe and efficient memory reuse**.

---

## Not a Systems Language — and That's the Point

This language is not designed to replace C or Rust for kernel development or writing device drivers. Instead, it's **designed for everything after that**:

* Writing your **application logic** without worrying about memory leaks
* Creating **UIs, simulations, games, robotics code**, or **server backends**
* Building **modular, hot-reloadable systems** that can evolve at runtime
* Wrapping unsafe systems APIs in safe libraries once—and forgetting about them

---

## Inspired by Go’s Pragmatism, Without Its Limitations

* Go’s CLI, toolchain, and zero-friction developer experience are excellent — and we're taking that philosophy further.
* All libraries are precompiled into dual static+dynamic packages so the compiler decides the best linking strategy.
* No Makefiles, CMake, `build.rs`, or `setup.py`. Just run your code. Instantly.

## Ergonomic, Expressive, Yet Safe

With f-strings, arena-aware string buffers, and value semantics by default, the language lets you express high-level logic easily:

```ts
foo(): void => {
    let root = Arena.newRoot();
    defer root.free();

    let result = "";

    root.useArena((arena) => {
        let buf = StringBuffer.new(arena, 64);
        let user = "ChatGPT";
        let version = 4.0;

        buf += f"Welcome, {user}, version {version}\n";
        buf += "The future of programming is here.\n";

        result = buf.toString(root);
    });

    print(result);
}
```

All memory is safely scoped. No GC pauses. No lifetime bugs. No hidden costs.

## Who It's For

This language is for:

* Teams building **high-performance applications** that run 24/7
* Developers tired of C++ complexity or Rust overhead
* Engineers who want **strong correctness guarantees** without giving up simplicity
* People who want to wrap low-level code once, and **never think about memory again**

---

## A Proof of Concept — With a Future

This is more than just a language—it's an **experiment in language design philosophy**:

* It revives forgotten ideas like **arena allocation** in a modern, type-safe form
* It reimagines tooling and packaging for simplicity and reliability
* It aims to bring **joy back to programming**—without sacrificing control

---

If you've ever felt that *Rust is too much*, but *Go is not enough* and *C++ gives you headaches*, this language might be exactly what you’ve been waiting for.
